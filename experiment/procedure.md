Start the experiment with default values of buildings' mass and stiffness. Pause the experiment after a few cycles and observe the response of SDOF by changing all the parameters.

**Observation 1:**

Vary the force value and note the corresponding variation in the response of SDOF with different values of forces.

**Observation 2:**

Vary the mass and stiffness of the building and note the corresponding variation in the response.

**Note:**

THe colour of the building indicates the mass of the building. The darker the colour implies more mass of the building.
