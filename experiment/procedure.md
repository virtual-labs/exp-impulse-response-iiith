Start the experiment with default values of impulse force and buildings' mass and stiffness. Pause the experiment after a few cycles and observe the response of SDOF by changing all the parameters.

**Observation 1:**

Vary the impulse force value and note the corresponding variation in the response of SDOF.

**Observation 2:**

Vary the mass or stiffness of the building and note the corresponding variation in the response.
